# Implementation Verification Tests

This directory contains the test scripts that were used to verify the implementation of the TranscribeTalk agentic architecture transformation. These scripts were created and executed during each phase of development to ensure correctness and completeness.

## Test Scripts

### test_phase1.py
**Phase 1: Foundational Architecture**

Tests the core components that form the foundation of the agentic system:
- Core module imports (Agent, Turn, Events, etc.)
- Event system functionality
- Component initialization
- Legacy code preservation

### test_phase2.py
**Phase 2: MVP Agentic Loop**

Verifies the minimum viable product with the first working tool:
- Tool registration and discovery
- Tool execution flow (list_directory)
- CLI integration (--auto-confirm, --dry-run flags)
- ToolScheduler functionality
- Turn class tool support

### test_phase3.py
**Phase 3: Expanding Capabilities**

Tests the expanded tool set and memory features:
- New file system tools (read_file, write_file)
- Memory management tools (save_memory, read_memory)
- Long-term memory integration with PromptEngine
- Tool safety metadata
- CONTEXT.md functionality

### test_phase4_simple.py
**Phase 4: Advanced Hardening**

Verifies the robustness features (simplified version without full dependencies):
- Loop detection logic
- Chat compression calculations
- File structure verification
- Integration points in Turn and Agent
- Advanced features (statistics, summaries)

## Running the Tests

These tests were designed to work with the project structure as it was being developed. To run them:

```bash
# From the project root directory
python tests/implementation_verification/test_phase1.py
python tests/implementation_verification/test_phase2.py
python tests/implementation_verification/test_phase3.py
python tests/implementation_verification/test_phase4_simple.py
```

**Note**: Some tests may require dependencies to be installed. The Phase 4 simplified test was specifically created to verify implementation without requiring all dependencies.

## Test Results

During development, all tests passed successfully:
- Phase 1: 4/4 tests passed ✓
- Phase 2: 5/5 tests passed ✓
- Phase 3: 5/5 tests passed ✓
- Phase 4: 6/6 tests passed ✓

## Purpose

These tests serve multiple purposes:
1. **Verification**: Ensure each phase was correctly implemented
2. **Documentation**: Show what was built in each phase
3. **Examples**: Demonstrate how to use the new components
4. **Regression**: Can be run to ensure nothing breaks with future changes

## Architecture Validation

The tests validate that the implementation follows the architectural blueprint defined in `AGENT.md` and incorporates best practices from `GEMINICLI.md`, including:
- Event-driven communication
- Modular component design
- Safety-first tool execution
- Resource management
- Extensibility patterns
